# Book_Recommendation_System-Capstone_Project_4

# Problem Statement 
During the last few decades, with the rise of Youtube, Amazon, Netflix, and many other such
web services, recommender systems have taken more and more place in our lives. From
e-commerce (suggest to buyers articles that could interest them) to online advertisement
(suggest to users the right contents, matching their preferences), recommender systems are
today unavoidable in our daily online journeys.
In a very general way, recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant
items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy, or anything else
depending on industries).
Recommender systems are really critical in some industries as they can generate a huge
amount of income when they are efficient or also be a way to stand out significantly from
competitors.

# The main objective is to create a book recommendation system for users.

### The Book-Crossing dataset comprises 3 files.

● Users :

Contains the users. Note that user IDs (User-ID) have been anonymized and map to
integers. Demographic data is provided (Location, Age) if available. Otherwise, these
fields contain NULL values.

● Books :

Books are identified by their respective ISBN. Invalid ISBNs have already been removed
from the dataset. Moreover, some content-based information is given (Book-Title,
Book-Author, Year-Of-Publication, Publisher), obtained from Amazon Web
Services. Note that in the case of several authors, only the first is provided. URLs linking
to cover images are also given, appearing in three different flavors (Image-URL-S,
Image-URL-M, Image-URL-L), i.e., small, medium, large. These URLs point to the
Amazon website.

● Ratings :

Contains the book rating information. Ratings (Book-Rating) are either explicit,
expressed on a scale from 1-10 (higher values denoting higher appreciation), or implicit,
expressed by 0.
